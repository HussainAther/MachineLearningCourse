Neuroimaging data are represented in 4 dimensions: 3 spatial dimensions,
and one dimension to index time or trials. Scikit-learn algorithms, on the other hand,
only accept 2-dimensional samples Ã— features matrices (see section 2.3).
Depending on the setting, voxels and time series can be considered as features or samples.
For example, in spatial independent component analysis (ICA), voxels are samples.

The reduction process from 4D-images to feature vectors comes with the
loss of spatial structure (see Figure 1). It however allows to discard
uninformative voxels, such as the ones outside of the brain. Such voxels
that only carry noise and scanner artifacts would reduce SNR and affect
the quality of the estimation. The selected voxels form a brain mask.
Such a mask is often given along with the datasets or can be computed
with software tools such as FSL or SPM.

Nifti_masker is used for applying a mask to extract time-series from Niimg-like objects.

NiftiMasker is useful when preprocessing (detrending, standardization, resampling, etc.)
of in-mask voxels is necessary. Use case: working with time series of resting-state or task maps.
