    "# Week 8 - Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's assignment will give you an opportunity to practice your classification skills with the scikit-learn package. You will have to apply several different classification methods and learn about their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sklearn the different options (called hyperparameters) for each classifier are specofied in the constructor when you initialize an object. Then, method __.fit(X, y)__ will run the training procedure where the classifier will learn from a set of samples and their features in __X__ and the corresponding class labels in __y__. Once the classifier model is trained you can use it for predicting the labels on previously unseen data with __.predict(X_new)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use various classification metrics to __evaluate the performance of the trained model__. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A balanced F1 score combining precision and recall is a good default performance measure for binary classifiers. However, for instance as in the example with handwritten digits - the problem is multiclass - where we have 10 classes, one for each digit. In extending a binary metric to multiclass or multilabel problems, it could be treated as a collection of binary problems, one for each class. It is, therefore, necessary to average the evaluation results. There is then a number of ways to average binary metric calculations across the set of classes, each of which may be useful in some scenario. Where available, you should select among these using the average parameter. Read more about __\"micro\" and \"macro\" averaging of classification metrics__ in scikit-learn documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"macro\" simply calculates the mean of the binary metrics, giving equal weight to each class. In problems where infrequent classes are nonetheless important, macro-averaging may be a means of highlighting their performance. On the other hand, the assumption that all classes are equally important is often untrue, such that macro-averaging will over-emphasize the typically low performance on an infrequent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if we make sure that each digit is represented by approximately equal number of samples, the performance of a classifier will be best evaluated using F1 with macro averaging across the classes. __StratifiedKfold__ class or a stratified train_test_split() can be used to make sure each class gets an approximately equal number of samples in a random split.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final, and probably, one of most important aspects of machine learning covered by this assignment - is to __avoid overfitting the models while they train__. Overfitting leads to a classifier that is showing excellent performance on the dataset used for training, while its performance on a previously unseen dataset could be average if not poor. __Cross-validation__ is an important technique to master. Fortunately, even the complex scenarios of cross-validation are already implemented and available for use in sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we need to choose between several classification models based on their performance, for instance the classifiers initialized with different hyperparameters, we need to make sure there is no overfitting of hyperparameters. It means that the choise of hyperparameters can be optimal for the training dataset but may not be optimal in general. __GridSearchCV__ class simplifies the hyperparameter optimization procedure, but you need to make sure to put aside a subset of your data for the final validation. __train_test_split()__ is the best way to split the dataset in sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot to explore in scikit learn documentation, take this opportunity, and ask your questions on Slack channel #week8 if something is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to a heavy use of randomization techniques the exact performance mertics may not be achieved (sometimes even with the random seed set) therefore the tests in assert statements will  validate your solutions roughly. Don't be surprised to get slightly different results when you restart your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 graded assignments and total 6 points: the first task is worth 2 points, the other four are 1 point each. Additionally, there is an ungraded assignment that we highly encourage you to solve.\n"
